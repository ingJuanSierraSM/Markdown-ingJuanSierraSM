Headings

--------

- Add from 1 to 6 (#) (depending on the heading level) before the words that compose it.
    - Always put a space after the number signs (#).
    - Put blank lines before and after a Heading.
- There is an alternative syntax for heading levels 1 and 2, on the line below the text, add any number of:
    - == characters for heading level 1
    - -- characters for heading level 2.
    
    <br>

    ```
    # h1: Heading Level 1
    ```
    
    ```
    h1: Heading Level 1

    ```

    # h1: Heading Level 1
